# Predicting House Prices

My project is a machine learning prediction using leaner regression.

It is written in Python on a notebook in Visual Studio Code. 

The code uses Scikit-learn to learn from the data and find how different attributes affect the price of a house. The data is imported from a USA housing prices dataset and then runs through linear regression to predict prices based on the attributes.

# Installation

Install Visual Studio Code, download Python, and create a Python notebook inside VS Code. Install pip and use pip manager in the terminal to install; numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Now download Scikit-learn and the dataset, then install them onto your VS code.

# Project Status

The project visualizes and prints how much different attributes cost per unit. 

I want to further the project by enabling a way to enter a house with certain attributes and printing a predicted price for that house using the cost per unit.
